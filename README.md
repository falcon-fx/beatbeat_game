# beatbeat_game
BeatBeat is a made up (and work in progress) game where you jump around on a grid to the rhythm of a beat, and try to avoid enemies.

## Idea
The user is able to load in their music, and start the game with a desired size and enemy count.

## Implemented/started so far
- Game logic
- Game view
- Game controller
## To-do
- Music loading
- BPM detection
- Nice graphics
