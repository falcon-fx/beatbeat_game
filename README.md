# beatbeat_game
BeatBeat is a made up (and work in progress) game where you jump around on a grid to the rhythm of a beat, and try to avoid enemies.

## Idea
The user is able to load in their music, and start the game with a desired size and enemy count.
The point of the game is to reach the top right corner from the bottom left corner, jumping to the beat, and avoiding enemies who also jump to the beat left or right, up or down.
Probably inspired by Crypt of the NecroDancer, but I have never played that game. :D
